Welcome. I am an evolutionary biologist working at the interface of biology, mathematics, and anthropology. 

I use mathematical modelling to address questions including why the human brain evolved, how development affects evolution, why major evolutionary transitions occurred, and what is a species. 

As part of this work, I have developed mathematical tools that integrate development and evolution. These tools have produced general formulas for computing how a system responds to perturbation, how to translate an understanding of development into an understanding of evolution, and how to model the development and evolution of human brain size and cognitive ability.
